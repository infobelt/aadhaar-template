Aadhaar Documentation
---------------------             

Documentation of the Aadhaar utilities can be found in the [Aadhaar readme](https://github.com/infobelt/aadhaar/blob/master/README.md)


Swagger API documentation
---------------------     

Once the application has been started, you can view the specific documentation for the
APIs exposed by your resource (web) controllers by browsing http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html.  

Note, if you've configured your 
application to run on a port other than 8080, you'll browse the documentation on that port.
